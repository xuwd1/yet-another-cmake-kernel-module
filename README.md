# Yet another cmake-kernel-module


## What is this
This repository contains a simple hello world kernel module cmake project that:
- Can be built with cmake
- **A proper [JSON compilation database](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html) could be generated by cmake for `clangd` BEFORE any successful build completes** 

It's different with the existing works that either:
- Fails to generate a proper compilation database that leads to huge amount of errors showing up in your editor
- Could only generate a proper compilation database AFTER a sucessful module build happens

This was made possible simply by generating and building a dummy module at cmake configuring time to get the compile options that Kbuild system emitted and instructing cmake to use similar compile options for generating the compilation database.

This repository was inspired by [cmake-kernel-module](https://github.com/enginning/cmake-kernel-module)

## Usage

1. clone the repository 
```shell
git clone https://github.com/xuwd1/yet-another-cmake-kernel-module
```

2. create build directory
```shell
mkdir build
cd build
```

3. configure the cmake project
```shell
cmake .. <OPTIONS>
```
available `<OPTIONS>` are:

- `-DFULLTREE=ON|OFF` : Wether to use the following specified full kernel source tree for building. **Required**
- `-DFULL_KERNEL_DIR=/path/to/full/kernel/source` : The full kernel source tree location. **Optional if -DFULLTREE=OFF and otherwise required**
- `-DHEADER_ONLY_KERNEL_DIR=/path/to/header/only/kernel/source` : The kernel header tree location. **Optional if -DFULLTREE=ON and otherwise required**
- `-DCLANGD=ON|OFF` : Wether to exclude the compile options that are not understood by `clangd`. **Optional but RECOMMENDED=ON**


After this step:
-  `compile_commands.json` will have been generated under `build` directory. Reload your `clangd` and you should see it functioning properly.
- A `Kbuild` file will have been generated under the source directory.


4. build the module:
```shell
make module
```

5. optionally do cleaning:
```shell
make module-clean
```

6. use this repository as a template and modify it to your own need.
